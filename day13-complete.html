            <h2>üìñ The Mystery of the Missing Water</h2>
            
            <div class="chapter">
                <h3>Chapter 1: The Puzzling Discovery</h3>
                <p>When Jade Martinez arrived at Franklin Elementary's science lab on Monday morning, she immediately noticed something strange. The three glass containers she and her lab partner Kevin had set up on Friday afternoon were not as they had left them. Each container had originally held exactly 200 milliliters of water, carefully measured and recorded in their lab notebooks. Now, however, the water levels were noticeably different.</p>
                
                <p>"Kevin, look at this!" Jade called to her partner, who was organizing their materials for the day's lesson. "Container A has about 150 milliliters left, Container B has maybe 175 milliliters, and Container C looks like it still has close to 200 milliliters. Where did the water go?"</p>
                
                <p>Kevin joined Jade at their lab station, his eyebrows furrowed with curiosity. "That's weird. Do you think someone took some of the water? Or maybe there's a leak in the containers?" He picked up Container A and examined it carefully, turning it upside down and checking for cracks.</p>
                
                <p>Mrs. Patterson, their science teacher, overheard their conversation and approached with a knowing smile. "Interesting observation, you two. Before you jump to conclusions, let me ask you some questions. What do you notice about where each container was placed over the weekend?"</p>
                
                <p>Jade and Kevin looked more carefully at their setup. Container A had been placed directly next to the window, where bright sunlight streamed in each day. Container B was positioned on the center table, away from direct sunlight but still in a warm area of the classroom. Container C had been placed in the supply closet, which was cooler and darker than the rest of the lab.</p>
                
                <p>"I think I see a pattern," Jade said slowly. "The container that lost the most water was in the sunniest, warmest spot. The one that lost the least water was in the coolest, darkest place."</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="chapter">
                <h3>Chapter 2: Forming a Hypothesis</h3>
                <p>Mrs. Patterson nodded approvingly. "Excellent observation, Jade. Now, based on what you've noticed, what do you think might have happened to the missing water? Remember, in science, we don't just guess‚Äîwe form a hypothesis based on evidence."</p>
                
                <p>Kevin raised his hand excitedly. "I think the water evaporated! We learned about evaporation last month when we studied the water cycle. Heat energy from the sun made the water molecules move faster and change from liquid to gas."</p>
                
                <p>"That's a good hypothesis," Mrs. Patterson agreed. "But how can we test it? In science, we don't just accept ideas without testing them. We need to design an experiment that will help us gather evidence to support or reject our hypothesis."</p>
                
                <p>Jade opened her lab notebook and began writing. "Let's set up a controlled experiment. We'll use identical containers with the same amount of water, but we'll place them in different locations with different temperatures. Then we'll measure the water levels every day for a week."</p>
                
                <p>Kevin added, "We should also make sure everything else is exactly the same‚Äîsame type of containers, same amount of water, same time of day for measurements. The only variable should be the location and temperature."</p>
                
                <p>Mrs. Patterson was impressed with their scientific thinking. "You're both demonstrating excellent understanding of experimental design. Remember, in a good experiment, we only change one variable at a time so we can determine what's causing the results we observe."</p>
                
                <p>The class spent the next thirty minutes designing their experiment. They decided to use six identical containers, each filled with exactly 250 milliliters of water. Two containers would be placed in direct sunlight, two in indirect light at room temperature, and two in the cool, dark supply closet. They would measure and record the water levels at the same time each day for one week.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="chapter">
                <h3>Chapter 3: Conducting the Experiment</h3>
                <p>Over the next five days, Jade and Kevin carefully measured the water levels in each container and recorded their observations in a data table. They noticed interesting patterns emerging from their measurements.</p>
                
                <p>The containers in direct sunlight showed the most dramatic changes. By Wednesday, these containers had lost nearly 30 milliliters of water each. The containers at room temperature lost about 15 milliliters, while those in the cool closet lost only 5 milliliters.</p>
                
                <p>"Look at this pattern," Jade said, pointing to their data table. "The rate of evaporation is definitely related to temperature. The warmer the location, the faster the water evaporates."</p>
                
                <p>Kevin made an additional observation. "I also noticed that the containers in the sunny location have more evaporation during the afternoon, when the sun is strongest. In the morning, the water level drops more slowly."</p>
                
                <p>Mrs. Patterson encouraged them to think deeper. "Those are excellent observations. Now, can you explain why temperature affects evaporation rate? Think about what happens to water molecules when they gain energy from heat."</p>
                
                <p>Jade remembered their previous lessons about molecular motion. "When water molecules gain heat energy, they move faster and faster. Eventually, they move so fast that they escape from the liquid and become water vapor in the air. The hotter it is, the more energy the molecules have, so more of them can escape."</p>
                
                <p>To make their experiment even more comprehensive, Mrs. Patterson suggested they also consider other factors that might affect evaporation. "What about air movement? Do you think wind or air circulation might make a difference?"</p>
                
                <p>Kevin had an idea. "Let's add two more containers to our experiment. We'll put one near the fan and one in a still area, both at room temperature. That way we can test whether air movement affects evaporation too."</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="chapter">
                <h3>Chapter 4: Drawing Conclusions</h3>
                <p>By the end of the week, Jade and Kevin had collected enough data to draw solid conclusions about their experiment. They created a bar graph showing the total amount of water lost from each container under different conditions.</p>
                
                <p>The results were clear: containers in direct sunlight lost the most water (45 milliliters), containers at room temperature lost a moderate amount (22 milliliters), and containers in the cool closet lost the least (8 milliliters). The container near the fan lost slightly more water than the one in still air at the same temperature.</p>
                
                <p>"Our hypothesis was correct," Jade announced to the class during their presentation. "Temperature is the main factor affecting evaporation rate. Heat energy gives water molecules more energy to escape from the liquid state and become water vapor."</p>
                
                <p>Kevin added, "We also discovered that air movement increases evaporation rate, probably because the moving air carries away the water vapor more quickly, making room for more evaporation to occur."</p>
                
                <p>Mrs. Patterson asked the class to think about real-world applications. "Where do you see evaporation happening in everyday life? How might understanding evaporation rates be useful?"</p>
                
                <p>Students raised their hands with examples: puddles drying up faster on hot, sunny days; clothes drying faster on windy days; and farmers using irrigation systems that account for evaporation rates in hot weather.</p>
                
                <p>Jade realized that their simple experiment had helped them understand an important natural process. "Science is everywhere around us," she concluded. "Even something as simple as missing water can lead to important discoveries when we approach it with curiosity and careful observation."</p>
                
                <p>As they cleaned up their lab station, Kevin reflected on what they had learned. "I used to think evaporation was just something that happened. Now I understand it's a process we can study, predict, and even control by changing the conditions."</p>
                
                <p>Mrs. Patterson smiled as she watched her students carefully record their final observations. "This is exactly how real scientists work," she told them. "They notice something interesting, form a hypothesis, design an experiment to test it, collect data, and draw conclusions based on evidence. You've all done excellent scientific work this week."</p>

            <p><strong>8. D) They move faster and can escape from the liquid</strong></p>
            <p><em>STAAR Skill: Understanding scientific concepts from text. Jade explains that heat energy makes molecules "move faster and faster" until they "escape from the liquid."</em></p>
            
            <p><strong>9. A) Temperature and air movement both affect evaporation rate</strong></p>
            <p><em>STAAR Skill: Summarizing information from multiple sources. The text shows both temperature and air movement influenced evaporation rates.</em></p>
            
            <p><strong>10. D) How quickly water changes from liquid to gas</strong></p>
            <p><em>STAAR Skill: Determining meaning of academic vocabulary. The context shows "rate" refers to speed, and evaporation is the liquid-to-gas change.</em></p>
            
            <p><strong>11. C) Puddles drying faster on hot, windy days</strong></p>
            <p><em>STAAR Skill: Making connections between text and real world. This example includes both heat and air movement, matching the experimental results.</em></p>
            
            <p><strong>12. B) By following the scientific method from problem to conclusion</strong></p>
            <p><em>STAAR Skill: Analyzing text structure. The story moves through observation, hypothesis, experiment, and conclusion in order.</em></p>
            
            <p><strong>13. B) Curiosity and careful observation lead to understanding</strong></p>
            <p><em>STAAR Skill: Identifying theme. The story demonstrates how asking questions and systematic investigation lead to scientific understanding.</em></p>
            
            <p><strong>14. C) "Science is everywhere around us"</strong></p>
